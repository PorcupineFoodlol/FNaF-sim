# FNaF-sim
A recreation of the original Five Nights at Freddy's game, made in Python. Running at 60 FPS, it has the office and camera modes, power usage, power drain, animatronic movement, and respective camera functionality. It's based on the custom night of the original game, so AI levels are adjustable in the game file (all set to 20 by default, the maximum difficulty), and the power drain works quick. It's primarily controlled by the mouse, just simple left clicks for all actions, and with the ability to press the escape key to close the game. There's even debug information available by activating the DEBUG constant found in the game file and monitoring the console.
Please report all bugs found, but any suggestions for additional features will be ignored.
